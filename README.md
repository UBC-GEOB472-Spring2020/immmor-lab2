Reflective analysis:
This interactive web map is for my friend. He will come to Vancouver to visit me in this May. His major is also Geography. He always asks me to introduce my living environment. Because of this course, i could just use a interactive web map to introduce some cool places to him. He will be surprised and love it. I believe so~ 

I only used one layer which is the UBC. I think it’s my most important place in Vancouver (I am here to study~), so i highlighted it. For the 3D terrain map with hypsometric tinting, I wanna show him Vancouver’s terrain in 3D. He loves terrain and new places’ terrain. The tour map is a slide show about my surrounding environment and some text to introduce, including UBC, Vancouver, Downtown Vancouver, Vancouver Airport,  Richmond Night Market and PNE. It basically achieve my expectations. For the tour map, i don’t actually want him to zoom in or zoom out. But he could play with the 3D terrain map to check the terrain details. One thing to improve my map is to highlight different regions when the map automatically zooming in, not be highlighted in default.

Critique sessions:
Some of us in this class created a facebook group chat. One student gave us a link very early. For his map, he did not zoomed into what he wants to talk about (It’s just a world map~). I learned from him and took care a lot in my project. For my own project, i tried to add text box on my map. I am so anxious when it doesn’t work even if i followed the tutorial carefully. I asked help from professor and in the group chat. Professor gave me some good hints. At the beginning, it doesn’t work either. I spent more time on it and finally fixed problem. What’s problem? The canvas or the map canvas actually is not set with any size which means that the map won’t show up… In addition, I need to make that text box above all!! Or it won’t show up either but hide under the map… Another big thing is we need give GitHub and mapbox some patience… They both need time to update my information!!!! About 1 minute.. But i am so anxious when actually i did nothing wrong but just because they need some time for the process... After i got these experiences or fixed these problems, i shared them with classmates in the group chat. They love it~
