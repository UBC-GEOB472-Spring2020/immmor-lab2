Collaboration and reliance on other resources: I did this map all by myself, but I do get some feedbacks from Oliver. There is no explanation or no theme about this map at the beginning. Oliver suggests that I need to make a "story" to link all these effects in my map. Then I made my map a math problem for tutorial. At the beginning, the yes or no effect for button is just ugly pop-ups without any cool stuff. He suggested me to change and add something. So I go to Code Pen website and find out that lightning effect. There is no explanation or no theme about this map at the beginning. Oliver suggests that I need to make a "story" to link all these effects in my map. Then I made my map a math problem for tutorial. I used the mapbox example for distance measurement: https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/measure/. The yes or no effect is from codepen.

Reflective analysis:
This interactive web map is for my student. Recently I became a math tutor for a primary school kid. This is a math problem for him to solve. He needs to first find where west parkade roughly is. Then measure the distance between the parking lot and the destination. Next, he needs to use my given factor to calculate the time and choose the correct answer. I used the text and buttons to guide him for each steps. It's very easy for him to understand what he needs to do. What this map needs to be improved is that the home page can be more beautiful. I wanna put those buttons or text over the map, but I can't fix it.. Maybe next time...
